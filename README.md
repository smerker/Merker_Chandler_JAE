# Merker_Chandler_JAE
Data and code for a simple N-mixture model in JAGS
Merker, S.A and Chandler, R.B. In Press. An experimental test of the Allee effects range limitation hypothesis. Journal of Animal Ecology.

JAE-data.gzip contains the data required to run the model including:
1) scaled and center covariates of detection
2) a 3 dimensional array containing counts of Canada warbler (cardellina canadensis) at 71 point count locations over 4 years
3) A climate PCA derived from PRISM data. 

The model itself is described in the .jAG file "Abundance_EN_clim-trt-D.JAG"

An appendix of the article is included.
